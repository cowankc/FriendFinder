Friend Finder is a social website that will match you with someone who you are most compatiblw with! It uses javascript, express, jquery, and node to run the application. When the application is ran, the user will be able to start and enter their name along with a link to a photo of themselves. After that they will answer 10 questions and submit their answers. The backend of the application will uses the submitted answers to run them against other users already store as an array. Once it determins which of the previous users is closet to the submited answers, it will show the matched users name and photo. The application will also save the new user to its array of users to be used in future matches. This application is useful in seeing the relationship between the backend and frontend of web development and how they each affect each other. This application was created by Kevin Cowan.
